        spent the first five years of his life in Mangalore, where his maternal
        grandfather, Ifthikar Ahmed, served as the chief engineer of the port in
        the 1960s.<br />
        Although Khan was given the birth name Shahrukh Khan, he prefers his

        wedding ceremony on 25 October 1991, after a six-year courtship.They
        have a son Aryan (born 1997) and a daughter Suhana (born 2000). In 2013,
        they became parents of a third child, a son named AbRam, who was born
        through a surrogate mother. <br>
